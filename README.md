# Authentication Microservice in Nodejs (no DB)

This is a project developed with [DIO](https://digitalinnovation.one/) :wink:

In this project it will create an **authentication microservice** :hammer::wrench:
with some endpoints:

### Users

* GET /users
* GET /users/:uuid
* POST /users
* PUT /users/:uuid
* DELETE /users/:uuid

### Authentication

* POST /token
* POST /token/validate
